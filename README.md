School van is one of the leading transportation modes used among Sri Lankan school children as it is convenient and safer than the other public transportation modes. Even though around 30,000 school vans/buses (According to state estimates) provide service in Sri Lanka, a vital requirement of proper information providing mechanism to the stakeholders of the school transportation is prevailing.

EasyVan is an application that allows all the school van owners to input details about school vans. If a parent is required to find a school van for the child, he/she could quickly browse through the application and find a suitable school van according to his/her specifications

Registered parents can enter their child’s details to the database. The mobile app will provide pinpoint, accurate information about the location of the school van. Always when a student boards in his or her school van and drops off at the school, an instant notification message is sent to parents. Parents can monitor any bus delays or route deviations and plan accordingly to avoid the last-minute rush or frustrating wait in the road. Parents can notify if the child is not coming on a day. Furthermore, school van fees can be directly paid through the application, which is more convenient when it comes to busy parents.

EasyVan allows drivers to notify parents and owners in case of emergencies and can broadcast announcements when required. Information about van delays, breakdowns, or unexpected situations is quickly brought to the parents' and owner's knowledge through instant alerts. EasyVan attendance system will provide accurate information about the child’s attendance for the drivers. Same time easyVan will act as a hub for school van owners to manage all the details about his/her school van. Owners get notifications about van service dates, license renew dates, etc. The calendar will help to keep summary about upcoming dates and past dates. Other than that, this application can be used to keep track of the income of the owner.
